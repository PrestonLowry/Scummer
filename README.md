# Scummer
Quick, Simple Dice Roller for 4/5E Shadowrun, No Fuss No Muss

OVERVIEW: 
Scummer is an app I wrote for my friends to participate in Shadowrun games with me. If you're unaware, Shadowrun is a TTRPG
with heavy cyberpunk leanings, and only uses D6s. 
However.
It uses an absolutely insane amount of D6s, more than most sane people have.
An example scenario would be shooting a handgun stationary, which could mean rolling as much as 17(!!!) dice all at once. 
Obviously, I don't expect each of them to run out and buy several packs of dice, so I whipped this up instead. 

If you want to use this Python program effectively, you need the following Python non-default packages:
*Pyglet
*ImageIO

And if you're on a Mac, you'll need to find an equivalent module to the default 'winsound' module I used for sounds.

Similarly, since this was not intended for distribution, you'll need to provide your own sound effects. I've left
the files in the (required) attached folders, but the sound files inside are not original due to me not owning the rights
to the sounds. You're on your own in providing replacements, but I suggest keeping the names in place. 
The images are both clipart, and therefore should not cause problems so long as I don't try and sell them. 

Enjoy!
